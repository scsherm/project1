Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\nLoad and transform the data for the analysis\n\n```{r}\noptions(width=120)\n#\n# write a function geteloaddatadf() - you will assign the return value to eloaddf\n# in the function do the following\n# 1. load the electric load data from elecloaddata.xlsx\n# you are not allowed to convert to .csv. Find an appropriate R package that can read .xlsx files and load\n# the data in a dataframe called eloaddf. The columns should be dates, kwh, kwVAR\n#\n# some notes on the data\n# the file has 15 min interval data from 1/1/2014 to 12/30/2015\n# when you import the data, the first column of your dataset should be dates in POSIXct format\n# HINT: use the strptime and as.POSIX.ct functions to form the eloaddf$dates\n#\n# write a function getweatherdf() - you will assign the return value to weatherdf\n# 2. Next load the weather data from NOAA into a data frame weatherdf. The data is in 1874606932872dat.txt\n# This is 1 hour interval data for a specific weather station close to\n# the location of the site from which electric load data was obtained\n#\n# you need to use fixed width parsing to read the data into a data frame.\n# add a column called dates to the dataframe similar to #1 above\n#\n# write a funcion getbillsdf() - you will assign the return value to billsdf\n# 3. Next load the bill data from billdata.xlsx\n# this data is monthly and carefully note the start and end date of each billing period. \n# name the fields of the dataframe as\n# billdate, billstartdt, billenddt, kwh, mindemandkw, actualdemandkw, custcharge, \n# distchrgkw, mttkwh, tbckwh,nugckwh, sbckwh, rggieekwh, deliverykwh, \n# totdeliverychrg, supplychrg, totalchrg\n#\n\n```\n\nWe now have 3 data sets\n\n1. Electric load data in 15 min interval\n2. Weather data in 60 min interval\n3. Bill data monthly\n\nLets do some simple analysis\n\nDisplay the monthly load profile\n\n```{r}\n# display a summary of the electric load data eloaddf$kwh by summarizing it by year, month and total kwh over each month\n# your answer should display 24 rows without the header.\n```\n\nNow let us do some plotting of the load data\n\n```{r}\n# form a dataframe called eloadhrdf with two columns dates, kwh\n# this dataframe sums the 15min kwh in the eloaddf to hourly data\n# next create a plot frame with two panels side by side\n# On the left panel show a heat map of kwh data for 2014 with x-axis as months and y-axis as hour of the day (1 to 24). use subsetting of the data frame rather than copying the data into yet another data frame\n# On the right panel show a heat map of kwh data for 2015 with x-axis as months and y-axis as hour of the day (1 to 24). use subsetting of the data frame rather than copying the data into yet another data frame\n```\nREPLACE THIS SECTION WITH YOUR COMMENTS ON THE DATA\n\nWe plot the weather data using boxplot to explore the variation in temperature graphically\n\n```{r}\n# plot the weather data. Use boxplots in ggplot2 with month on the x-axis and temperature in y-axis\n```\n\nWe are now ready to build a simple predictive model.\n\n```{r}\n#create a dataframe with hourly interval data inside your function by \n# combining selective columns from eloadhrdf and weatherdf\n# your dataframe should be called modeldatadf and the columns should be dates, year, month, hrofday, temp, kwh\n#\n#\n# write a simple function called predmodel. the model object should be the return parameter\n# pass in the appropriate data frames.\n# \n# you should fit a GLM with the following specification kwh ~ month + hrofday + temp\n# your model should only use 2014 data for your prediction model\n#\n# use the summary function and display the results of the function\n```\n\nREPLACE THIS SECTION WITH YOUR COMMENTS OF YOUR \"TOY\" PREDICTIVE MODEL. FOCUS ON WHICH COVARIATES \nARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT\n\nNow show you skills in Machine Learning!\n\n```{r}\n#\n# use the dataframe modeldatadf\n# split it into training and testing data sets based on 2014 data for training and 2015 data for testing\n# Use the GBM algorithm in the caret package in R to train and validate the model.\n# You have free reign to display and explain your results graphically\n#\n#\n```\nLets now compare the predicted model for 2015 with the bill data kwh!\n\n```{r}\n#\n# run your machine learning model and create a data frame of dates, kwh for 1hr interval data for 2015. note you\n# may need to include the last few days of 2014 in your dataset due to the billing dates in January (see billdata.xlsx)\n# call your data frame pred2015df.\n# now for each of the 12 rows (billing periods) in the billsdf, sum the kwh for the date range in each of the rows from pred2015df for the corresponding start and end of billing in billsdf \n# create a resultsdf which has billdate, predkwh (from pred2015df), actualkwh (from billsdf)\n# display the results\n```\n\nThis completes this little exploration of energy load data.
